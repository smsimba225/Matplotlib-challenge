# Matplotlib-challenge

This challenge was a deep dive into combining tables, cleaning data, visualization, and analysis.  

I really enjoyed this exercise because it showed how powerful both pandas and matplotlib were, as well as some other modules, like scipy.  With pandas I was able to easily combine two csv files into a single dataframe, and manipulate and clean the data. Using the .loc function, I was able to identify mice that were duplicated, and removed them from the data. It was also interesting to see how easy it was to calculate summary statistics like mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM while also using the .groupby function to analyze data separated into categories. I also liked how the challenge required us to use the aggregation method, enforcing the idea that there are usually more than one way to do something.

Using the data to visualize using bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and scatter plots allows us to easily see trends and comparisons between the different Drug Regimens.  

The most interesting part of this challenge was being able to calculate both quartiles and interquartile range using Python and being able to visualize the data into box-plots.  I also enjoyed using Python to create a linear regression equation using the data.  It really goes to show how powerful this coding language is.  

Thank you for looking at my work!
